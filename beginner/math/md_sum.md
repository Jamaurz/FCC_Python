__Title:__ Python Sum

__Description/Explanation/Lesson:__

The function sum(iterable) adds all of the items in a Python iterable (list, tuple, and so on) from left to right and returns the total.  
There is an optional second argument, start, that defaults to 0 and is added to the total.  
The iterableâ€˜s items are normally numbers, and the start value is not allowed to be a string.

```
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> sum(numbers)
15
>>> sum(numbers, 1)
16
>>> sum(numbers, 10)
25
```

__Code Prompt/Challenge:__

There are two lists of numbers.  
Find the sum of all of the items in both lists and assign that value to a variable named total.  

__Pre-defined Code:__
```
list1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
list2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

__Solution:__
```
list1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
list2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
total = sum(list1, sum(list2))
```

__Tests:__
```
class UnitTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_main(self):
        self.assertIsInstance(total, int)
        self.assertEqual(total, 55)
```
