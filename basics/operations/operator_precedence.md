## Operator Precedence / Order of Operations  
### From the [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence)  
The following table summarizes the operator precedence in Python, top to bottom, from lowest precedence (least binding) to highest precedence (most binding).

**Note**  
Some of the terms below, such as lambdas and bitwise operations, have not been covered yet.  
If you see an unfamiliar term, worry not young padawan. For reference only, this chart is.

[5]	The % operator is also used for string formatting; the same precedence applies.  
[6]	The power operator ** binds less tightly than an arithmetic or bitwise unary operator on its right, that is, 2**-1 is 0.5.
