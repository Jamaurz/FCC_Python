## FCC_Python

[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) is building a Python curriculum and I want to help.  

My main focus for now is writing code challenges and lessons that focus on Python basics.

The challenge_recipe.py file contains a template for the code challenges.  

I am currently working on math lessons.  
TODO: min(), round(), sum()
