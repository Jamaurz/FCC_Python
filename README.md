## FCC_Python

[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) is building a Python curriculum and I want to help.  

View live: https://freecodecamp.github.io/python-coding-challenges

My main focus for now is writing code challenges and lessons that focus on Python basics.  

The challenge_recipe.py file contains a template for the code challenges.  

### [Curriculum Outline and Organization](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/python-coding-challenges/issues/8)

In the root directory of the project there will exist a directory: **challenges**, and a file called **classroom_settings.json**

The **challenges** directory will contain each lesson directory title like so: `[C#].[L#].<name>` i.e. 2.1.Addition (means the Addition lesson is Lesson 1 of Chapter 2).
Due note that chapter and lesson numbers is for our organization purposes and will not be reflected in the Repl.it Classroom.

Each lesson directory will contain four files:

1. lesson_code.py
2. lesson_tests.py
3. lesson.md
4. lesson_settings.json  

lesson_code.py will be loaded into the initial-code section (top left container) of the classroom.

lesson_tests.py will be loaded into a hidden unittest file (behind the scenes).   
To run the tests from the console:
1. Make sure that you are in the \<lesson> directory
2. `â‡’  python3 -m unittest <lesson>_tests`

lesson.md will be loaded into the markdown section (bottom right container) of the classroom.

lesson_settings.json will be used to store information such as Title, Chapter, Lesson number, ID(?). This will mainly be for FCC, but repl will be able to utilize the Title property and maybe the ID property.

Each Repl.it Classroom lesson url will be added to the challenges.json file in the project root directory.

### Adding a new challenge or fixing an existing one? (must be done in the python-coding-challenges repo)

- Generating challenge ID:
  1. Open your terminal
  2. run `mongo`
  3. run `ObjectId()`
  4. copy string and paste into lesson_settings.json

- Building challenges.json file:
  1. Open your terminal
  2. Navigate to project directory
  3. run `node generate-challenge-json.js`
  4. if no errors are thrown you're good to commit and open a pr

- Opening a PR
  1. Include a reference to the issue
  2. If its a new challenge, mention the chapter its being added to
  3. continue being awesome and helping us create this curriculum!
