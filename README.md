## FCC_Python

[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) is building a Python curriculum and I want to help.  

My main focus for now is writing code challenges and lessons that focus on Python basics.

The challenge_recipe.py file contains a template for the code challenges.  

I am currently working on lessons for operators and operations.  
TODO: https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations  
might be a bit much for beginners; I'll throw it in and maybe move it to intermediate later.

###  Structure for coding challenges:  

Chapter Direc. > Lesson Direc. > (unittest.py, init_code.py, lesson.md)
